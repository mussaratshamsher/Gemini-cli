# Introduction: Building Intelligent AI Agents With Gemini & Docusaurus

## 📖 About This Book

This short technical book is a hands-on guide to designing, building, and publishing simple AI agents using modern tools like Gemini and Docusaurus. It introduces the reader to the fundamentals of AI agents—how they differ from traditional chatbots, how they are structured, and how they can be used in real-world applications such as automation, robotics, and intelligent assistants.

Readers will learn how to:

- Understand the core concept of AI agents
- Set up a complete development and documentation environment
- Design a simple but effective agent architecture
- Use Gemini to assist in generating structured, technical content
- Publish a professional-looking AI book online using Docusaurus and GitHub Pages

By the end of this book, you will have your own AI agent-based book project live on the web, gaining practical knowledge of both AI systems and technical documentation workflows.

## 🎯 Target Audience

This book is intended for:

- Beginner to intermediate software developers
- AI learners and students exploring Agentic AI
- Technical writers experimenting with modern documentation tools
- Web developers interested in Docusaurus & documentation systems
- Hobbyists & tech enthusiasts wanting to publish a tech book online

A basic understanding of the command line (Terminal / PowerShell), JavaScript or Python, and Git/GitHub will be helpful but not strictly required.
